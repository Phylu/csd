# Cyber Security Dashboard

Cyber Security Dashboard for my Master's Thesis at TUM

## Data Input

Beware that you will need to get your data from somewhere if you want to have a useful dashboard.

The data is provided by two .csv files. Use the sampler python script to create random data for testing if needed.

If there is no data source available, dummy data is used instead.
